However, this book pertains to a different kind\nof anchor. In Michael Brooks’ (Anchoring, n.d.) words, an\n\nanchor, in the context of Neuro-Linguistic Programming\n(NLP) is either an internal or external representation that\n\ntriggers an emotion, a memory, or a feeling in a person. For\nTerry Elston (Anchoring, n.d.), anchors are the representation\n\nof a person’s inner world to the outer world.\n       The idea of anchoring first came into the scene when\n\nRichard Bandler and John Grinder were exploring Milton\nErickson’s hypnotic techniques. Based on Erickson’s studies,\n\nhypnotic triggers aid a person in changing his / her internal\nstate or re-access a certain hypnotic trance state. From this\n\nidea, Bandler and Grinder developed the technique and\nincluded other internal processes which aimed to generate the\n\nsame effect but without undergoing into a hypnotic state. It\nwas in the year 1976 that the first anchoring techniques were\n\nintroduced (Dilts & DeLozier, 2000).\n       Every now and then, one comes across a certain trigger\n\nfrom the environment that unlocks a trunk full of emotions. It\nmay come from any of the senses—a smell, a color, a taste, and\n\n\n\n                               10"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:24:49 UTC +00:00]]

The stimulus\nthat initiates an emotional response is called an anchor\n\n(Anchors Away, 2012).\n\n       Noted NLP developer, trainer and consultant Robert\nDilts (1999) defines anchoring as “the process of associating\nan internal response with some external or internal trigger\n\nso that the response may be quickly, and sometimes covertly,\nre-accessed.” He also believes that in order to fully grasp the\n\nconcept of anchoring, one must look at apply its concepts\ninto the context of teaching and learning. He elaborates that,\n\n“the process of anchoring, for instance, is an effective means\nto solidify and transfer learning experiences. In its simplest\n\nform, ‘anchoring’ involves establishing an association between\nan external cue or stimulus and an internal experience or\n\nstate…” (Dilts, 1999).\n\n       Moreover, anchors are used in order to elicit the\nfollowing results (Dilts & DeLozier, 2000):\n\n       1. Focus awareness\n       2. Re-access cognitive knowledge and internal states\n\n       3. Connect experiences together in order to enrich\n           meaning and consolidate knowledge\n\n       4. Transfer learning and experiences to other contexts\n\n       Dilts and DeLozier (2000) also mentioned that cues as\nanchors aid in transferring knowledge to other context. These\n\ncues may either be verbal, non-verbal or symbolic—even a\nperson can become an anchor. Here are some objects/items\n\noftentimes used as cues to create anchors:\n\n       •\t Stimuli: voice tone, gestures, locations, key words\n       •\t Symbols: metaphors, slogans\n\n\n\n\n                                11"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:24:49 UTC +00:00]]

Bernard Jordan\n\n\n        •\t Universals: analogies, common experiences\n\n        They further added that items or objects found in one’s\nhome or office can be a great anchor point. This is because\n\nthese places are frequently experienced and more often\nthan not, these places are already familiar; thus anchoring\n\nbecomes easier. Dilts (1999) also believes that for an anchor\nto be effective, it should be implemented at the right time. As\n\nwith the case of teaching and learning, for the instructor to be\neffective, he must be able to know the right time on when to\nintroduce a new topic to his students. He must not jump right\n\naway to the heart of the topic without ‘preparing’ his students\nto become more like a sponge—ready to absorb whatever it is\n\nthat he is going to teach.\n\n\n        When the teacher senses that there’s a kind of a\n        readiness, or a surge, or openness in the group,\n        at that moment he or she would introduce the\n        concepts or show the key words. Because the point\n\n        of anchoring is that a teacher is not just giving\n        information, he or she is also providing stimuli\n        that get connected to the reference experiences of\n        the learners. This is why stimuli that are symbolic\n\n        are often more effective anchors (Dilts, 1999).\n\n\n\nAnchoring in Daily Life\n\n\n        Anchors (the “trigger“, or stimulus) can come in\n        an infinitude of possible forms: verbal phrases,\n\n        physical touches or sensations, certain sights\n        and sounds, or internally, such as words one\n        says to oneself, or memories and states one is in.\n\n\n\n                                 12"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:24:49 UTC +00:00]]

One instance is that of what is being used by\nteachers, as elaborated earlier. Dilts (1999) further explained\n\nthat anchoring in teaching is more than just a matter of\npresenting cognitive maps and providing examples to\n\nstudents. The student’s commitment and willingness to learn\nalso plays a major role in the process.\n\n\n        Sometimes a teacher will want to let a discussion\n\n        go on, not just because people are making logical\n        connections, but because the energy level of the\n        group is intensifying, and you want to capture that\n        moment. In other times, if the state of the group\n\n        is low, the teacher might not want to anchor that\n        state to certain topics or reference experiences\n        (Dilts, 1999).\n\n\n\n        Another situation given by Dilts (1999) is when\na couple is preparing for childbirth. In this scenario, the\n\nhusband takes the role of the coach to the expectant mother.\nThe major challenge for the coach (husband) is how to\n\ntransfer all the knowledge when the real situation comes.\nChild birth in simulation compared to the actual are very\n\ndifferent from each other. With the intensity on the emotional\nand physical level, more often than not, the things that the\ncouple has done in practice will be all wiped out.\n\n\n\n                                 13"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:24:50 UTC +00:00]]

This is needed\n           if there is no strong emotion that is evoked from a\n\n           situation being targeted as the anchor.\n\n               Sample: Print ads showing skinny models tell\n               you that being skinny is equivalent to being\n\n               beautiful.

These anchors can be naturally or artificially.\nThis technique is widely used and is proven to be applicable in\neveryday life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                               15"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:24:50 UTC +00:00]]

As a matter of fact, he already\n\ngained a Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1904, even\nbefore classical conditioning was identified. His Nobel award\n\nwas about a research on the digestive system of dogs.

This process was then\ncoined “conditioning” as it defines conditions under which\na stimulus may be ineffective or “reflex-neutral”. Later on in\n\nhis experiments, Pavlov began to substitute highly specific\nmanipulated stimuli in exchange of the less controlled ones.\n\n       Ancient philosophers such as Aristotle have pointed\n\nout the importance of temporal associations on learning new\nactions called Associationism but it was Pavlov who initiated\nan empirical and objective study about associations. The\n\nidea that intrigued Pavlov is on the thought that dogs do not\nneed to learn certain things to achieve the same response. It\n\nis specifically the idea that dogs don’t learn to salivate at the\nsight of food. It’s an unconditioned response, meaning, it does\n\nnot need to be learned. In his quest to dig on the subject, he\ndiscovered that any object a dog associates with food would\ntrigger an equal response.\n\n\nClassical Conditioning Variables\n\n       Classical conditioning involves several variables\n\nwhich are important to understand in order to have a\nworking knowledge of how these variables are labeled and\n\nused in the conditioning process. Ivan Pavlov identified\nthese variables himself and up to present, these are the\nterms that have been widely used. The most independent\n\nvariable is called the unconditional stimulus (UCS), say\nfor example, food. An independent variable that may be\n\nassociated with it is the response it elicits known as the\nunconditional response (UCR). If food is our UCS, salivation\n\ncan be the UCR, as in Pavlov’s research.\n\n\n                                19"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:24:51 UTC +00:00]]

Bernard Jordan\n\n        Another independent variable that exists even before\nconditioning is what we call a neutral stimulus (NS). However,\n\nonce this variable is successively paired with the presentation\nof the UCS, it then acquires the function eliciting the same\n\nresponse as with the UCR. Therefore, this NS becomes a\nconditional stimulus (CS). A great example of a NS gradually\n\nevolving as a CS is when a metronome ticks while presenting\nfood. Originally, it will not elicit salivation but pairing it\na couple of times with food will eventually gain the same\n\nresponse even if presented individually.\n\n        Unconditional stimulus is any stimulus that elicits\na certain unconditional response naturally. This makes it\n\nreflexive in nature. Another example that fits this response\nis that of a loud sound (UCS) that can create a reaction as\n\nUCR. The intriguing discovery that Pavlov found out in\nhis experiment is that after pairing the samples of a NS\n\nsuch as a metronome, bell, or light with the presentation\nof meat, it started to elicit salivation as well.

These principles are briefly discussed in the\nnext sections:\n\n\nAcquisition\n\n       The impact of classical conditioning variables has\n\nbeen studied carefully through a number of researches. It\nhas resulted to the discovery that the interval between the\n\nunconditioned and conditioned stimulus is a very important\nvariable to consider. Conditioned stimulus should come first,\nfollowed by the unconditioned stimulus, usually in an interval\n\nof a second, in order for a classical conditioning to make a\nsignificant effect. In 1927, Pavlov discovered that the timing of\n\nthe CS plays a crucial role and presenting it way too early or\ntoo late may result to little or no effect to the behavior of the\n\nexperimented dogs.\n\n\nExtinction\n       Pavlov made some studies regarding the effect on\n\nthe CS after being presented a number of times without the\npresence of the UCS used for conditioning, but has been\n\nestablished only after successful conditioning. He then\nfound out that the CR diminishes and eventually disappears.\n\nExtinction is the principle in classical conditioning that\noccurs when the conditioned response is weakened due to the\nrepeated presentation of the conditioned stimulus without the\n\nunconditioned stimulus. In Pavlov’s experiment, the dogs that\nhave been trained to salivate once the bell rings have tend to\n\n\n\n\n\n                               21"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:24:51 UTC +00:00]]

Following complete\nextinction of the CR, if the UCS is paired with the CS again,\n\nthat CS regains the ability to elicit CR immediately after one\npairing.

Bernard Jordan\n\n\neven when you’ve just knocked on that neighbor’s door and\nhave not even seen the dog.\n\n\nClassical Conditioning and Learning\n\n       Classical conditioning is the process of acquiring\na response to a new stimulus by associating it with an old\n\nstimulus. This process is done by coupling a stimulus with a\nphysiological response. Pavlov’s classical conditioning study\n\nproposed that a response become established by association\nwith an environmental stimulus. With this form of learning,\n\na stimulus or an event predicts the occurrence of another\nset of stimulus and event. To put it simply, it was discovered\nthat behavior can be developed through a set of stimulus-\n\nresponse associations.\n\n       In Pavlov’s experiment, he resulted with dogs\nresponding to a new stimulus that was previously irrelevant\n\nor neutral. This physiological discovery was attributed to\nlearning. Learning takes place upon establishing the S-R\nassociation. Once a neutral stimulus and a reflex response\n\nare associated with an unconditional stimulus, the nature\nof association switches from unconditional to conditional.\n\nIn Pavlov’s thorough investigation on the paradigms of\nclassical conditioning, he learned potential implications and\n\napplications that may be used even outside the laboratory.\n       One example is exploring whether classical\n\nconditioning might be the cause of some animal and human\nbehavioral problems. This was evident on his work on what\n\nhe called “experimental neurosis” that occurred during an\nexperiment on some difficult variation process in stimulus\n\ndiscrimination.

It is basically\nthe connection of a stimulus and a certain response. This\nkind of technique works if you relive an intense state and\n\nat the height of that experience you relate or associate a\nstimulus. What the brain does then is link these two events\n\nneurologically.\n\n       Intentional or not, we use NLP anchors in different\nsituations in our lives. Notice how you associate brand names\nand their quality together. What’s good about NLP anchoring\n\nis that we can connect certain triggers with positive emotional\nstates—confidence, optimism, happiness as if switching the\n\nTV’s remote control.\n\n\nSetting Up NLP Anchors\n\n       The logic of setting up an NLP anchor is very much\nthe same as in the procedure done by Pavlov with his dogs.\nBy associating a unique trigger to a certain state, you can set\n\nan NLP anchor. An example is by associating a unique trigger\nto being happy. When you are in that state, trigger a unique\n\nanchor to associate the anchor and the state together.\n\n       Once established and repeated a number of times, the\ntrigger associated with happiness can anchor you to a happy\nstate just having that unique trigger or anchor. For you to\n\nfurther understand this NLP anchor set up here are the steps.\nAgain, we are using the state of happiness as the response that\n\nwe need to achieve.\n\n       1. Pick a memory. To make use of NLP anchoring,\n           the first thing you need to do is choose a particular\n           memory with strong feelings attached to it.

Intensity. The intensity of the state can greatly af-\n         fect the impact of an NLP anchor. The stronger the\n\n         intensity, the better it would be. In other words, set-\n         ting an anchor in a low intensity will result to a weak\n         impact.\n\n     2. Timing. The timing in triggering the anchor also\n\n         plays a vital role in the anchor’s efficiency. To get\n         better results, trigger the anchor only when you are\n\n         at the highest point of the desired state—the most\n         intense moment.\n\n     3. Uniqueness. The anchor’s uniqueness is also\n         important as it should be something that you don’t\n\n         normally do. Otherwise, we cannot arrive at an\n         effective anchoring. Refrain from triggers as ordinary\n\n         as scratching, snapping the fingers, or clapping.\n     4. Replicability. This denotes that you should be able\n\n         to repeat or replicate the anchor you’ve initiated the\n         same way it was first fired off.\n\n     5. Number of times.

The fundamental idea of\nthis is to make your words trigger some state or feeling to a\n\nlistener. This can be done by varying the voice tone.\n\nVoice Tone\n\n        The voice tone or intonation can be one of the most\n\nuseful ways to anchor specific words. People are able to\ndistinguish what someone tries to imply by simply noting\n\nthe voice tone of the speaker. Using an intonation that is\ndescending or deepening actually denotes a command or\n\nsomething that needs paying attention to, while a rising\nintonation may be denoted as a question.\n\n       Another means to anchor using the voice is to\nmispronounce, stutter or hesitate over particular words and\n\nphrases.\n\n\nKey Words\n       If your goal is to just put ideas into a person’s mind\n\nwithout the person’s awareness, the speaker can use other\nanchoring ways such as using keywords. For a sales person,\n\nthe anchor phrase may consist of key words that are repeated\nwithin the spiel or conversation with the subject. This is\n\npossibly in between long intervals of the conversation.\n\n       The speaker can create sort of triggers to anchor the\nkey words by touching the listener gently on the hand or\narm. As you may notice, politicians on televisions apply this\n\nkind of anchoring by broadly leaning toward the interviewer\nevery time the word or phrase is said. By doing this, they are\n\nanchoring the keyword to a positive friendly body movement.\n\n\n\n\n                              33"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:24:53 UTC +00:00]]

Bernard Jordan\n\n\nGestures\n\n       Gestures can also be another way of a verbal anchoring\ntechnique. Speakers can subtly mark conversations using\nconsistent gestures. An example of this is during a job\n\nevaluation interview when the employee describes his job\nperformance over a specific duration. In describing targets\n\nthat has not been met, the employee would gesture only with\nthe left hand, using a motion that implies backwards.\n\n       On the other hand, every positive achievement is mo-\ntioned with a gesture of the right hand, implying “forwards”\n\nby creating a rather subtle movement. Towards the end of the\ninterview the employee anchors all points that supports pro-\n\nmotion or increase in salary by first making the same forward\ngesture using the right hand, and then states the point. Un-\n\nconsciously, the boss or interviewer would associate the move-\nments of the right hand with that of the positive points.\n\n\nPriming\n\n       Influencing people without them knowing about it can\nalso be done through similarly related way called “priming”.\n\nIn NLP, this technique can be considered a gentle yet\npowerful anchoring technique. How does this work? Before\n\na conversation or a session starts, the initial words that the\nsubject would listen to are those concepts and ideas that the\ntherapist wants to anchor. Certain ideas are delivered in the\n\nmost casual off-hand way which then registers in the subject’s\nunconscious without getting noticed. Though it is very subtle,\n\nthis will influence the action and behavior of the subject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              34"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:24:53 UTC +00:00]]

The purpose of eliciting responses is to create a\nfavorable atmosphere for sending your message across\n\neffectively.

We use our senses\n\nto anchor different triggers to re-live an experience and make\ngood use of it.\n\n       Seeing\n       Among the different types, visual NLP anchoring is the\n\nmost commonly used. This is because people have the tendencies\nto lean towards the visual sensory data greatly. Anchor a state\nusing visual triggers.\n\n       It works by associating a visual cue to a specific state\nthat one has experienced. Making a face or doing a specific\n\ngesture—whatever that other sees. These are some samples\non how to create visual NLP anchors. The technique here is\n\nto make it more unusual. In that way, it becomes uniquely\nassociated to the created trigger.\n\n       Visual anchors are around us every day. Thinking of\n\nthe person you really like, picturing that person’s face in your\nhead and notice how you feel as you think of that person. That\nis how we anchor our emotional state to that person.\n\n       Now, try to imagine a person that has wronged you and\n\nmade you really angry. Again, visualize that person’s face in\nyour mind as you did with the first one. Notice how flustered\n\nyou become just imagining that person. The emotional part\nof our brain associates our experiences with emotions. This is\nwhy positive or negative anchors are created.\n\n\n\n\n                               45"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:24:55 UTC +00:00]]

Bernard Jordan\n\n       Hearing\n       The auditory NLP anchoring on the other hand, allows us\n\nto associate anchors in the form of sound. It can be an old song\nthat brings back memories, or an angry voice tone, or a particular\nself-talk. These sounds work similarly as with the visual NLP\nanchor. Making the anchor more intensified and repeating it\n\nover and over, these sounds are linked neurologically to the\nexperience that triggers them.\n\n       NLP anchoring, through the auditory system, is done\nby linking an auditory cue to a particular state that one gets to\n\nexperience. Creating a weird noise, whistling a melody of a song\nor speaking in a different tone of voice can be good examples of\n\nthis—anything that another person can hear. Just like in visual\nNLP anchors, sound or auditory NLP anchors are emotional\n\nstates tagged and associated in your experiences. This means\nthat these anchors are not limited to positive ones. Depending\n\non what is being anchored, it may either be positive or negative.\n       On a different note, an auditory digital anchor can\n\nalso be used.

One example that applies to this is uttering the\nword “quiet.”\n\n       Touching and Moving\n\n       Kinesthetic NLP anchoring is another type of\nanchoring.

There’s that unexplainable feeling that wells up\n\nwhen that person touches you. That touch becomes linked to\nthat emotional state.\n\n       Same thing happens when a person you dislike touches\nyou. Since anchors can be negative as well, that particular\n\naction brings a feeling of dislike because of how the brain\nassociated that action with the emotions. Kinesthetic anchors\n\nare also a good way that you can use as a tool to boost your\nconfidence, feel energized, and have a disposition of a winner.\n\n       Smelling\n\n       Olfactory NLP anchoring is the type of anchoring that\n\nconnects to that part of the brain called amygdala.

This is\nbeneficial to set anchors for you to experience the particular\n\nstate of your choice.\n\n       As this type of NLP anchor is very powerful, it can also\nbecome a very strong negative anchor.

It uses internal or\nexternal representations to activate a memory, a feeling, or\n\na behavior. By doing this, you can trigger selected behaviors,\nemotions, as well as thought patterns in order to bring about\n\nchange or improvement in your life.\n\n       To give you a greater view on how this is done, here’s a\nprobable example. When driving and you see the traffic light\n\nturns red, you will step on the brake even without pondering\nabout it. It has become automatic that this process is done\n\nunconsciously. But this wasn’t all natural. It was learned. Of\ncourse, when you were just starting to learn how to drive, this\n\naction is something you still need to think and decide about,\nbut when you’ve become too familiar to it, it developed into an\nautomatic response.\n\n       Generally, we are unaware that anchoring is happening\n\nin our lives. It happens outside our sensibility. But we can\npurposely use anchoring to teach ourselves to eliminate\n\nnegative behaviors—vices like smoking and drinking,\nlow self-esteem, and the like. We mentioned internal and\n\nexternal representations. How does this work? Internal\nrepresentations are initiated when we encounter a unique\n\ntrigger and when there is a response.\n       Life is a combination of anchors—both intentional and\n\nunintentional. We can encounter them through the different\nadvertisements we see, on how your favorite food smells, the\n\nmusic we hear from the radio, etc. On another note, since\n\n\n\n                               49"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:24:57 UTC +00:00]]

A negative behavior that may be familiar\nwith most couples is anchoring something that one has done\n\nto seriously hurt the other’s feelings and eventually cause\nthe relationship to be on the rocks. This causes one party to\n\ntrigger some negative emotions on the other without even\nknowing the reason.\n\n       But, good news is that we can take advantage of NLP\nanchoring to tackle stubborn conditions. To achieve this,\n\nanchoring is performed by a practitioner in a step-by-step\nprocedure. First and foremost, the situation is induced using\n\na trigger. The relationship between the desired state and the\naction to induce the situation is marked by creating a trigger\n\nthat would associate the two. The action is done every time\nyou are in the specific state.\n\n       Anchoring is also a remedy to battle our cravings\nand eventually get rid of bad habits. Intentional anchoring\n\nis commonly used as part of hypnosis. In our day-to-day\nactivities, this can be translated in different ways. Don’t\n\nyou know that when dining in a restaurant and you say\na compliment to the waiter who is serving you, you are\n\nunconsciously creating an anchor that tells the waiter that\nit’s an honor to be serving you?

You can also make use of anchoring to\nattach a positive feeling towards a chore that you’ve once\n\nperceived as unpleasant.\n       Anchoring is more than a technique—it’s a\n\nphenomenon. When we use anchoring correctly, it can make a\ndifference on people that we encounter who are facing a great\n\ndeal of challenges. Moving forward and getting desired results\ncan be done through the help of right anchoring.\n\n\nThe Art and Science of Anchoring\n\n       A phone that is ringing makes you want to pick up\nthe receiver and entertain the call. This phenomenon seems\n\nautomatic to you is because you have answered calls more\nthan a dozen of times before. When you have just moved to\n\na new house or office, have you experienced going to the old\nplace by mistake? Or are you able to break that habit easily.\n\n       What goes through our mind is a response to\nsomething else. And most of them are those that have been\n\nanchored in one way or another. But it is not to be mistaken\nas something that adds complication to the things that we\n\ndo. On the contrary, once you’ve learned this powerful tool,\neverything works as naturally as possible.\n\n       Anchoring is the process of creating a new response to\na given stimulus. But it’s not classical conditioning as it is. It’s\n\nreally a hypnotic phenomenon and, once you’ve perfected it, it\ncan work exactly the way you desire it to be.\n\n       Anchors are not just bound to keeping ones state of\n\nmind. They work similarly to propellers that can lead you to\nthe specific direction you want it to go. It will all just depend\non how they are set up.

This is\nfor the purpose of trying to make this activity fruitful and\n\nmeaningful for all of us. Hence, let us first take a look at a\nparticular aspect of Pavlov’s conditioning. This particular\n\naspect of conditioning is something that is quite connected to\nour understanding of the conditions of anchoring. Remember\nthat anchoring, as a technique carries different names\n\ndepending on who uses it, when, and how it is used.\n\n       According to Mukherjee (2008) anchoring is in the\n“surface similar to the ‘conditioning’ technique used by\n\nPavlov (p. 1).” Thus, in offering a platform for the conditions\nof conditioning, we will see the link between on the one\n\nhand, Pavlov’s conditioning and the idea of anchoring, on the\nother hand. Not only that the idea of anchoring is different\n\nfrom that of conditioning but also in order to provide good\nconditions for anchoring. Hopefully, whatever is the result\nof analyzing the needs for conditioning will help us know the\n\nconditions of anchoring.\n\n        In Pavlov’s idea of conditioning there are only two\nfactors involved: first, our internal responses and the elements\n\nwhich such responses have made to occur. This element is\ncommonly known as stimuli while the reaction which the\n\nstimuli is directed to is called response. In simple terms,\nstimuli-response is what constitutes conditioning for Pavlov.\n\nAs Murkherjee (2008) asserts:\n\n\n       In the behaviourist’s stimulus-response\n       conditioning formula, however, the stimulus is\n       always an environmental cue and the response\n\n\n\n                                59"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:24:59 UTC +00:00]]

Again, Mukharjee (2008) noted:\n\n\n        In NLP this type of associative conditioning has\n        been expanded to include links between aspects\n        of experience other than purely environmental\n        cues and behavioural responses.

This may somehow already explicit in\nthe process of conditioning. But what makes us think that\n\nit is explicit? The stimulus – response is the key.

But Pavlov’s argumentation did not stop there.\n\n        He explained further that such conditions are not\n\nenough for the dog to respond from hearing the sound and\nthe salivation activity does not occur from the mere hearing\n\nbut went on to explain that the presence of the object must\nbe within the dog’s reach.

It is quite impossible to\n\nhappen unless you have started to condition the dog that by\nthe ringing of the bell you show the dog of its food. Mukherjee\n\n(2008) added in reference to anchoring and learning that:\n\n\n        There is another aspect to anchoring related to the\n        fact that Pavlov’s dog had to be in a certain state\n        for the bell to mean anything. The dogs had to be\n        hungry; then Pavlov could anchor the stimulus to\n\n        the response (p. 2).\n\n\n        The passage provides us a hint on how the conditions\n\nof anchoring must be approached and that the idea of\nanchoring itself implicitly offers those conditions only that\n\none has to undress the idea to bring in the surface those\nconditions. It may not be difficult a task yet we have to be\ncareful so that we can have good anchoring practice.\n\n        Applying this to human beings has different reception\n\nthough we can argue that just like Pavlov’s dog our responses\nare based on the stimuli that caused us to response but the\n\nmanner we respond to stimuli is totally different from a dog\nwhich only flows from his instinct whereas for human beings\n\nour responses are sometimes, if not always, controllable and\ncan be scrutinized by our understanding. Quite similar to\n\nMukherjee’s (2008) analysis when he retorts:\n\n\n        A person may consciously choose to establish and\n        retrigger these associations for him or herself.\n        Rather than being a mindless knee-jerk reflex,\n        an anchor becomes a tool for self-improvement.\n\n        Anchoring can be very useful tool for helping to\n\n\n                                61"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:24:59 UTC +00:00]]

These\nthings contributed to the simultaneous activity, on the one\n\nhand, thinking of ideas to write; on the other hand, things that\nI remember when I type some words in here as well as when I\n\nsay the keypads, the texts, and allot more.\n\n       The next question that may be asked is what particular\nanchor was present then? This question can be answered\n\nthough is not covered by this chapter. Nevertheless, the\nanswer can be varied depending on the appreciation of the\n\nreader. Some may think that the anchor can be the thought\nitself. Others may find the words as the anchor why some\nmemories suddenly appeared.\n\n       Others may think that some external stimulus\n\nlike the keypad or the glass of juice beside the computer\ntriggered the experience to happen. Whatever the anchor\n\nmay be is beside the point. What is important here is to\nidentify the conditions of anchoring and not the anchor\n\nitself. So by this, we can be successful to apply the technique\nin order to obtain good results.\n\n       In the writing of Mukherjee (2008) he provided\nsteps on anchoring which are good examples of applying the\n\ntechnique as well the conditions for anchoring. Several of\nthese conditions are common sense and anyone can easily\n\n\n\n\n\n                               68"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:25:00 UTC +00:00]]

I would like to cite these conditions which the\nauthor labelled as “Well-formedness” conditions of anchoring.\n\n        These conditions are: intensity and purity of the\n\nresponse, uniqueness of the stimulus used as the anchor,\ntiming of the pairing of stimulus and response, context\nsurrounding the anchoring experience (Mukherjee\n\n2008).

The\n\nfollowing are part of the descriptions Mukherjee (2008)\ndescribed for each condition:\n\n\n    1. Intensity and “Purity” of the Response – intensity\n        has to do with how fully a particular state or\n\n        response has been accessed…”purity” of response\n        has to do with whether or not the response or\n        experience you are attempting to anchor has been\n        “contaminated” by other irrelevant or conflicting\n\n        thoughts, feelings or reactions…It is possible\n        that a person may very intensely experience the\n        state to be anchored, but also mix it with other\n\n        states and experiences. Another way to state\n        this condition is that you will get back exactly\n        what you anchor…If you ask a person to think of\n        something positive, but that person is recalling\n\n        a dissociated memory of the event, and judging\n        whether or not he or she has chosen the right\n        event, then you will be anchoring disassociation\n        and judgment.\n\n\n\n                                69"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:25:00 UTC +00:00]]

Uniqueness of the Stimulus Used as the “An-\n        chor” – it relate to the fact that we are always\n        making associations between cues in the world\n\n        around us and our internal states and reactions…\n        Unique stimuli make better and longer lasting an-\n        chors.

Studies\n        involving classical conditioning have shown that\n        this association proceeds only forward in time;\n        that is, the stimulus (the bell) must precede the\n\n        response (salivating when eating food).\n\n\n    4.

Applying for example the first condition of anchoring,\n         when you try to recall your experiences from the past,\n         how vivid are those experience that when you try to\n\n         go over with the bits and pieces of it you are able to\n         identify and recall even the minute details? From\n\n         what kind of experiences do you find the intensity as\n         low and high? Are happy moments and sad moments\n\n         both correspond to high intensity of responses?\n     2. What stimuli do you have that you consider as\n\n         ineffective anchors? Why are they ineffective\n         anchors? Are shaking hands or touching a person’s\n\n         shoulder ineffective anchors? What other forms of\n         activity or expressions and symbols do you think are\n\n         ineffective anchors?\n     3. How do you find the surrounding as one of the\n\n         conditions of anchoring? Do you think it has\n         significant role in making the practice successful?\n\n         What if the surrounding is contrary to the condition\n         being given? Would it affect greatly the person’s\n\n         concentration as well as the result of the practice?\n         What do you think would be the ideal surrounding?\n\n\nActivity\n\n       The activity is individual. In order to have an optimum\nbenefit from the anchoring, the person must do the following:\n\n     1.

The so-called mantra makes you feel either bored and\nthen fall asleep or making your mind fixated to one thing you\n\nrepeatedly recited. Just like any other forms of mantra, when\nwords or feelings are repeatedly exercised, anchoring is never\n\nfutile. It does in fact help one to install anchors for certain\nemotions or feelings.\n\n       Paul M. Maher (n.d.) in his article said that anchors\n\nexist all around you. People, things, and places are just but few\nof the possible anchors that can create changes of emotional\nstate. Maher (n.d.) gave us a series of questions to consider:\n\nHave you ever come across an old photograph which created\na pang of nostalgia? Heard an old song which was popular\n\nduring a special time of your life? Smelt a particular aroma\nthat brought memories rushing back? Do you frequently visit\n\na location and always sit at the same place? Haveyoueverheld\na new born baby and noticed how your emotional state changed.\n\nAll these links or associations which can trigger our memories are\ncalled anchors. Bailey (n.d.) gives us four tips to anchoring, which\nshe considered as one of the simplest techniques available that can\n\ncreate massive and powerful changes of state in us in an instant.\n\n\n                               76"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:25:01 UTC +00:00]]

NLP anchoring uses a stimulus; it may\n\nbe a sound, an image, a touch, smell or a taste to trigger a\nconsistent response in you or someone else (Controlling\n\nStates with NLP Anchoring, n.d.). Hence, anchoring is one,\ninstalling it is another. A good analogy for this is the tool box\n\nwithout different tools inside and the object readily available\nto be fixed or built. Say, an object like pieces of wood to be\nformed a chair or table. While the materials are ready and\n\nthe toolbox does not run out of tools necessary for carpentry,\nthe use of woods to form a chair or table needs tools to install\n\nthese pieces of wood. Just like anchoring, the anchors are\nthere; ready to present itself when needed but installing those\n\nanchors to form gain certain result is necessary.\n       We know that the most common use of anchoring is\n\nto access resources, feelings and states when you want them;\nother uses are gaining control over emotions, accessing\n\nmemories and creativity and influencing responses in other\npeople (Controlling States with NLP Anchoring, n.d.). But\n\nthis differs from installing anchors which the preceding\nenumeration of uses is brought to surface. When one knows\n\nwho to install anchors, the uses of anchoring emerge as\nits consequence. Hence, the installation is important for\nvarious reasons namely, for function, use, and mastery. Just\n\nlike any other uninstalled equipment, proper installation\nis tantamount to effective operation or working of the\n\nequipment.

One cannot simply ask questions randomly\njust like asking questions to a stranger whom you like to talk\n\nwith. It is not as simple as “what is your name?” “By the way,\nI am so and so”, “what about you?” These forms of questions\nare of course always present in a conversation between two\n\nstrangers who want to make friends with each other.\n\n        Selling a product to a new buyer is just like that. But\nthe only difference lies on the approach. Unlike in a meeting\n\nof two unknown individuals who wish to be acquainted with\none another, a seller who desires to sell his/her products\n\neasily would have to create interesting questions such that the\nquestions posed will leave the buyer with no option but to get\n\nthe product.

Of course, you\nhave to be good at installing your anchors first in order to be\nsuccessful in your work such as this.\n\n        For Carl Buchheit (n.d.), creating an anchor is not a\n\nway of creating change.

There are\n\nsteps in order to replace negative states towards positive ones\nthrough collapsing anchors. The article “Collapsing Anchors:\n\nReplace Negative with Positive” (n.d.) presents to us three\nbasic steps:\n\n    1. Preparation\n\n           In the preparation stage, one shall have negative\n       state to be collapsed and the positive state to be\n\n       installed. Try and choose a specific scenario which\n       causes you to respond negatively and which you wish\n\n       to change. For example, choose a scenario with a\n       friend who caused you anger, disappointment in work,\n\n       jealousy with someone who has more comfortable life\n       than you, or shame when you fell from the school stairs\n\n       in front of so many students.\n               Secondly, choose a positive state you would like\n\n       to install instead; for example, relaxation, inspiration,\n       happiness or contentment. Remember also the\n\n       instances or memories that you felt this way.\n\n               The article “Collapsing Anchors: Replace\n       Negative with Positive” (n.d.) also emphasized\n\n       that your positive state must be stronger than the\n       negative state – otherwise this technique won’t work\n\n       as well as it could.\n    2. Setting the Anchors\n\n           First, anchor the negative state, by rubbing the\n\n       thumb and finger of your left hand together whilst\n       you relive the memory. Make sure that you are fully\n\n       associated when you do this – which means seeing\n\n\n                               86"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:25:02 UTC +00:00]]

In\n\nfact, in the 1994 version of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (as\ncited in Gandy, n.d.), Freud maintains that patients:\n\n\n                                95"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:25:04 UTC +00:00]]

At first, Freud accepted Dora’s explanation of\nevents, in which her father actually had an affair with Herr\nK’s wife, and he was only projecting that gaffe towards her.\n\nThe initial nervous coughing symptoms were cured. But in\nFreud’s insistence to cure Bauer further, he became impatient,\n\nirritable, and finally, disappointed, when she refused to accept\nhis interpretation of events—that Dora was also sexually\n\nattracted to Herr K. (Gay, 1998).

Understanding other people\nis crucial in a lot of settings, be it within the household or in\n\nthe workplace, so we can adapt properly and come up with\ndecisions around that newfound understanding.\n\n       Since it originated from psychoanalysis, why is\ntransference then an important aspect of therapy?

According to\n\nGrant and Crawley (2002), transference allows a therapist\nto see the roots of a person’s conflicts and difficulties, as well\nas examine how much the past plays a role in the present.\n\nThe therapist encourages the patient to continue on his or\nher transference by assuming a neutral and passive role\n\n(Eason, 2011).

We often see mothers as either the Wicked\n\nWitch of the West or the Fairy Godmother. For instance,\nemployees vie for the attention of female managers as they\n\nare seen to be nurturing and caring for their staff (the Fairy\nGodmother). However, if the female manager suddenly acts\ntough, strict, and/or stern with the rules, then she has the\n\ntendency to be seen as the Wicked Witch.\n\n       Sibling transference is usually rooted on families with\nabsentee or abusive parents (Sensale, n.d.). If you’re part of\n\nthis kind of family or know someone who is, you will notice\nthat the bond between siblings is stronger since they take care\n\nof each other in the absence of a more authoritative figure.\nIn the workplace, sibling transference often happens when a\n\ngroup tends to simply band together without much need of a\nleader role. More often than not, however, this can also lead to\nanarchy, wherein there would be a more blatant disregard of a\n\nleader’s authority.\n\n       Other transference explains why we have stereotypes\nand biases towards some people. We project non-familial\n\npatterns on other people (Bell, 2011). If you look back on\nour example of the policeman in the alley, the comfort felt\n\nwhen the man in uniform came is a perfect example of other\ntransference—even though you haven’t even talked to him,\n\nyou already treat him as someone you can trust. The same\ngoes for our thoughts of immediately running to the doctor\n\nwhen someone is physically hurt.\n       In a clinical setting, another example would be erotic\n\nand eroticized transference (Ladson & Welton, 2007).

Bernard Jordan\n\n\n       We have seen that transference is an unconscious\nactivity that traces its roots back to the 19th century, when\n\npsychoanalyst Sigmund Freud is developing his structure\nof the mind. The idea originated in a therapy setting. It\ngoes hand-in-hand with counter transference, wherein the\n\ntherapist would feel strong positive or negative emotions\ntowards the patient.\n\n       In examining how transference works in the minds\n\nof people, we looked at the optical illusion of the three black\ncircles with pie-shaped wedge cuts. This is relatable to the\nway we form schemas throughout or lives, thereby dictating\n\nour relationships. Transference could either take the form of\npaternal, maternal, sibling, other, or counter transference.\n\n       Lastly, transference is highly beneficial for the\n\nindividual to be a more proactive person than a reactive\none. However, in a clinical setting, it limits itself only to the\nrelational issues; not the biological ones.\n\n\nPersonal Application\n\n       1. Take a look around. If you are in your workplace,\n\n           observe how you see the people around you. Do\n           you have a particular father figure that you look up\n\n           to? Do you perceive your female boss as either the\n           nurturing kind or the strict kind? Examine your\n           relationships with other people, and see how you\n\n           are treating some (or most) of them the same way\n           you did to someone in your past.\n\n       2.

It aims to access re-\nsources and/or feelings whenever you want them, thereby\n\ngaining freedom from unwanted feelings and thoughts (Da-\nvis, n.d.).

How can one prove to be\nbeneficial to the mentee?\n\n\nWhat is a Mentor?\n\n       A “mentor” is one of the concepts that lack a universal\n\ndefinition, as it has been applied to different contexts since\nits inception (Berk, et. al., 2005). To simplify things, the\n\nlexical definition refers to a mentor as a “wise and trusted\ncounsellor or teacher” and/or “an influential senior sponsor\nor supporter” (Dictionary.com, n.d.). As a relationship\n\nbetween two people, the mentor helps the mentee to learn,\ndevelop the latter’s skill set, improve his or her performance,\n\nand reach that person’s full potential (Mentor SET, 2008).\nThis can be done in two ways: formally, as in the case of\n\naccomplished executives assigned by the company to a\n\n\n                               109"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:25:05 UTC +00:00]]

The idea of mentorship actually originated\naround 3,000 years ago, when the Greek poet Homer\n\nrecounted the story of Odysseus in the epic poem titled The\nOdyssey (Berk, et. al., 2005; Metros & Yang, 2006). As the\n\nstory goes, the Greek king and warrior left his son Telemachus\nin the hands of his friend named Mentor, in order to guide,\n\ntutor, and protect the boy while Odysseus goes to war.\n\n       In ancient Greek, mentoring refers to the technique\nof imparting social, spiritual, and personal values to younger\n\npeople (Metros & Yang, 2006). From that time forwards, the\nconcept of mentoring has taken many forms. In fact, there\nwere more than 20 diverse definitions of mentoring by the\n\nmid-1970s, with none of them chosen as the most “acceptable”\none (Berk, et. al., 2005).\n\n       Mentoring is sometimes confused with or regarded as\n\nsynonymous to coaching. However, the two refer to different\nthings. Although related, Management Mentors (n.d.) differ-\n\nentiated one from the other by saying that “mentoring is re-\nlational, while coaching is functional.” Compared to coaching\n\n(where the practice takes place within the confines of a formal\nrelationship like the workplace), mentoring calls for establish-\ning a relationship that goes well beyond the formalities.\n\n       Mentors strive hard to holistically develop the\n\ncharacter of the mentee, even outside the workplace or\n\n\n\n                               110"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:25:06 UTC +00:00]]

Now who can\nbe called a mentor? Who can take on this important role?\n\nRegardless of whether the mentorship was established\nthrough formal or informal means, those who can proudly\nbe called mentors are: 1) senior employees or executives\n\nwho were assigned by the management of the company\n(the department head, most of the time); 2) people who\n\nvolunteered to mentor a particular person; or 3) specific\npersons who were chosen by the mentees themselves (London\n\nMetropolitan University, n.d.).\n\n\nThe Connection Between Mentoring and Anchoring\n       The thing about anchoring is that it is largely an\n\nunconscious process (Gandy, n.d.) but it is happening in our\ndaily lives (Exforsys, 2007). Through the use of stimulus (e.g.\n\nimage, touch, or smell) repeatedly ingrained to our brains, we\ncan learn to associate those to more pleasant thoughts and\n\nemotions which we can connect to as the need arises (Davis,\nn.d.). Through the use of this technique, there are ways to\ntrigger a pleasant emotion to your mentee, in order to bring\n\nout his full potential and have him perform to the best of his\nabilities. There will be more on this topic as the chapter goes\n\non. For now, let us relate anchoring to mentoring.\n\n       Think of anchoring as the “Force” in the world-re-\nnowned sci-fi movie Star Wars. The Force is a constant ele-\nment around the galaxy, described as an omnipresent energy\n\nthat only those who are sensitive to it (i.e. Jedi’s) can fully\nharness (Hill, n.d.). The Jedi Knights, when they start out as\n\nYounglings, were largely unaware of the Force.

Mentors make sure\n\nthat they can properly equip their mentees, so the latter can\nbe leaders themselves and effective mentors to future people.\n\nEven the Bible is rife with stories of mentoring, even though it\ndidn’t really use the term (Jones et. al., n.d.).\n\n       Look at the relationships of Jethro and Moses, Moses\nand Joshua, Elijah and Elisha, Naomi and Ruth, Paul and\n\nTimothy, and Jesus and His disciples (Jones et. al., n.d.;\nGot Questions Ministries, n.d.). As stated in Philippians\n\n4:9 (NIV), the Apostle Paul encouraged the people from\nchurch of Philippi to put into practice the things that they\nhave learned, received, and heard from him. Christianity\n\nurges church leaders to mentors themselves, as this is what\nJesus did to his disciples. How should they do this?

You have to constantly learn how you can help\nguide your mentee.\n\n       No one can deny that emotions greatly affect how we\n\nsee things, and consequently, how we decide. When a past\nexperience hurts us, our natural reaction would be to avoid\nsimilar situations in the future. When the same situation\n\npresents itself, we find ourselves immediately averse of it.\nAccording to MacGregor (n.d.), “emotion is the language of\n\nthe subconscious mind.” When we feel a particular emotion,\nbe it good or bad, that is the time when we imprint that\n\nexperience in our minds, thereby creating our memories.\n\n       Why do you think it’s so easy to feel nervous\nbefore going up the stage? Your mentee may have had\n\nprevious experience that initiated that stage fright. Some\nwould automatically feel bored just with the mention of\n\n“readings,” since he or she has associated this act with dull\nand dreary work in the past. How would anchoring then\nbenefit you as a mentor?\n\n       First of all, it helps remove negative anchors, such as\n\nfear and anxiety, in your mentees (Exforsys, 2007; Positively\nRiding, n.d.). That stage fright is an example of a negative\n\nanchor. What if he or she needs to recite in front of the class\nor speak in front of the school? Fear of public speaking would\n\ntruly impede the student from attaining good grades. When\nan athlete finds it hard to “get in the zone” whenever the game\n\nstarts—that is also a negative anchor.\n       Moreover, anchoring can help strengthen one’s\n\nmotivations, as well as improve their focus and concentration\n(Positively Riding, n.d.).

A\ngood way to assist students to get over this phase is through\n\nthe use of anchored instructions. According to Chen (n.d.),\n“The anchored instruction approach is an attempt to help\n\nstudents become more actively engaged in learning by\nsituating or anchoring instruction around an interesting\n\ntopic.” This technique has been around as far back as 1929,\nsince educators noticed that the knowledge of students then\nseems “inert” when it comes to practical or problem-based\n\napplications (Oliver, 1999).\n\n       How do you go about this? For instance, mentors\ncan opt to use various visual elements like photos, graphics,\n\nnews clips, and videos as anchors whenever the class is\ntackling a rather challenging topic (Chen, n.d.; Pennsylvania\n\n\n                               118"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:25:07 UTC +00:00]]

Videos are actually\nhighly recommended for this (Oliver, 1999). The main idea\n\nhere is to provide a problem-based anchor (e.g. storytelling\nvideos) that would present the problem in a way that would\n\nmake the student think of the solutions themselves. One\nexample is the Jasper Woodbury Problem Solving Series\n\ncreated by Vanderbilt University, wherein math concepts are\nincorporated within the video story (Chen, n.d.). In one story\ntitled “The General is Missing,” the students need to solve\n\nalgebraic equations left as clues of the abducted grandfather,\nso that the protagonists can find him and save him.\n\n       This kind of learning environment inspires students\n\nto engage with the material through effective thinking skills\nand attitudes, in order to solve the problem at hand (Chen,\n\nn.d.). However, one limitation of this kind of teaching is that\nthe standardized curriculums for most schools would make\n\nit hard to deviate from the lesson plan and apply a new kind\nof teaching (Oliver, 1999). One way to go around this is by\npicking the right time as to when you can follow an anchored\n\ninstruction plan for the class or for the individual without\ncompromising other lessons.\n\n       Another thing that you can apply to help students focus\n\nis to anchor what you want the students to accomplish (e.g.\nclean the classroom) into a bodily kinesthetic signal (CfBT\n\nFoundation Trust, 2010). You can use music or physical\nmovement as a form of signal that a task should be done.\n\nFor instance, you can raise your hand, which would mean\nthe lesson is about to start so they all need to settle down.\n\nThis would take repetition in order for all the students to\nincorporate the anchor.\n\n\n\n\n                               119"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:25:07 UTC +00:00]]

What is this\n“in the zone” state that seems to be so important to athletes?\n\n        According to Crabb (n.d.), “in modern sports, the ability\n\nto access these flow states and optimise mental skills can mean\nthe difference between winning and just competing!” A lot of\nathletes would tell you that they really can’t explain how they\n\ncan access that part of their mind wherein their focus and\ntheir concentration on winning the goal is so intense that it\n\ndictates the way they play the game. As with anchoring, this is\nan unconscious act. Let’s pattern our example on NLP Coach\n\nJimmy Petruzzi’s (2011) advice on how to anchor a soccer\nplayer’s performance on a positive memory. He has uploaded\n\na YouTube video demonstrating this, which is also accessible\nthrough his website (refer to references section).\n\n        Say, your mentee has confidence problems whenever\n\nhe is in the basketball court. The idea here is to find a time\nin his life wherein he felt truly confident in his abilities as a\nbasketball player. Have him visualize that memory. Was it his\n\nbuzzer beater shot that cinched their team the championship\nfor that year? Was it his first winning game? Whatever it\n\nmay be, have him think of it in as much detail as he can—the\npeople watching, what he was wearing then, how he felt, etc.\n\n        Then, when the intensity of the emotion is already at\n\nits peak (remember the four keys), it’s time to associate that\nemotion to an anchor.

The concept dates back to the times of ancient\nGreeks, and it has evolved to varying definitions today\ndepending on the context it was used. But to simplify, mentors\n\nare those who are considered as wise counsellors or teachers.\n\n       Mentoring is a relationship based on trust and respect\nof the people involved. We looked at how this practice can\n\nbenefit a lot of people, both from the side of the mentor and\nthe mentee. Mentoring can help increase the commitment of\npeople in an organization, strengthen the talent pipeline, and\n\nfacilitate knowledge sharing between departments, and train\nfuture leaders well.\n\n       The last section delves into the application of\n\nanchoring in different settings, in order to remove negative\nanchors, strengthen their motivation, and improve their\nconcentration. There are four keys that are crucial in setting\n\nup anchors, namely: uniqueness, intensity, purity, and\nprecision. Specific examples were given for the three contexts\n\nthat can be used as frameworks for future anchoring program:\nin the academe, in the workplace, and in sports coaching.\n\n\n\n\n\n                              122"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:25:07 UTC +00:00]]

Before trying on anchoring for your mentee, perform\n       anchoring in yourself first. Is there a memory that\n       hinders your effectiveness as a mentor?

Remember that\n       every relationship is a two-way thing, so look at the two\n\n       sides—the language you use as well as the non-verbal.\n       Should you be more positive with your words? Is there\n\n       a negative quality that your mentee needs to let go of?\n    3. Have an honest personal assessment of your\n\n       mentoring skills.

How can\n\n       you improve more?\n\n\nActivity\n\n       Based on what you’ve read, and possibly on other lit-\nerature that you will examine, come up with your own cus-\ntomized anchored program for your mentee.

Sit down\n\n       (or you may have your most comfortable position but\n       not inviting to sleep), put your feet at the floor and\n\n       make sure you breathe deeply.

Pick a certain emotional state you want to access.\n       Think of an occasion when you had a highly\n\n       pleasurable, positive, or enjoyable experience (Eason,\n       n.d.) It can also be a certain attitude: curious,\n       happy, ecstatic, resourceful, calm, relaxed, sleepy,\n\n       or orgasmic. Whatever the state you want to anchor\n       with, the method remains the same, as long as the\n\n       positive feeling or emotion is wonderfully vivid and\n       experienced by you. Engage with the experience as you\n\n       see what you saw then (looking out through your own\n       eyes), hear what you heard, touch as what you touched,\n\n       and feel what you felt (Eason, n.d.).

You may use the memory\n       of a film that made you feel with that certain way, a\n\n       book or even better a real event as long as the process\n       of recalling becomes easy along the way. Then affirm\n       yourself through this question: Do you remember how\n\n       GOOD you felt recalling positive states?\n\n\n\n\n\n                               132"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:25:08 UTC +00:00]]

You may use any piece\n\n    of song or some particular sound as your sound\n    anchors. For example, how many times have you\n\n    returned from vacations to find out that some songs\n    bring out an ecstatic feeling from you having fun at\n    some beach club?\n\n4. Sound retrieval.

Double the images and make the\n\n    sounds stronger. Eason (n.d.) said that you should\n    ideally anchor at the maximum amplification of that\n\n    emotional state. Remember that in a successful sound\n    anchoring, uniqueness, timing and intensity are key\n\n    factors and must be considered seriously.\n\n6. Note the emotion and make it even more pure.

That is the reason why you have to fully\nconcentrate in this anchoring technique. You could create an\n\nanchor for creativity, and anchor for motivation, an anchor\nfor feeling powerful, an anchor for love, or an anchor for\nhappiness (Sodha, n.d.).\n\n       An anchor is anything which triggers our emotions, be\n\nthey positive or negative (Demant, n.d.). But there are keys in\norder that anchoring is effective in whatever purpose you are\n\nengaging with whenever and wherever you may want to use it.\n    a. Intensity\n\n               The more intense the state, the more powerful\n\n       the anchor is (Cathmont-Prynn, 2010). When creating\n       your anchor, you must do it at the peak of emotional\n\n       intensity (Sodha, n.d.). This is called a self-hypnotic\n       phenomenon (Cathmont-Prynn, 2010).

So if the emotion you want to experience\n       is absolute and total empowerment and motivation,\n\n       get yourself to that state by either remembering a\n       time when you were in that state or imagine what it\n\n       would be like to be in that state (Sodha, n.d.). If the\n       experience is extremely intense, it may be that the\n       association is strong after only one occurrence (NLP\n\n       Anchoring & Pavlov’s Dogs, n.d.). At this point, for\n       this kind of emotion it’s a good idea to get your whole\n\n       body involved as this will add to the intensity (Sodha,\n       n.d.).

As the intensity\n\n       of the experience lessens, so does the association.\n\n               The best time to make an anchor is when you\n       are experiencing the state that you want as fully as\n       possible and as wonderfully vivid as it was before\n\n       during the actual experience (Using Anchors, n.d.). If\n       you can maintain this intensity for a longer period of\n\n       time, it is more likely the anchor will be successfully\n       established and easy.\n\n               Again, the stimulus/trigger should be applied\n\n       ONLY when the emotional state AMPLIFIES and\n       the trigger should be removed when the state peaks\n\n       (Cathmont-Prynn, 2010).

Again, as Demant\n(n.d.) would say, an anchor is anything which triggers your\n\nemotions, be they positive or negative. It is very important\nto bear into consideration what kind of emotional state\nyou would like to associate and be linked with.

This is a technique when you\nuse a single anchor which can trigger off more than one state.\n\nFor example, you could use a single anchor (e.g. listening\nto your favourite music) to simultaneously trigger states of\n\ncalmness, confidence, and enthusiasm by recalling each state\nin turn (Using Anchors, n.d.). This is having a single anchor\nfor the three states.

It may be the following:\n\n    1. Usually you haven’t experienced the desired emotional\n\n       state at a strong level enough for the anchor to stick.\n       The intensity of the emotional states is importantly\n\n       needed as a key factor. You want to anchor the feeling\n       at its peak, when it is most strongly felt. To initially\n       build the feeling up within you, think of the last time\n\n       you really felt that way. For instance, if you want to\n       have more confidence, think of the last time you really\n\n       felt confident. If you want to feel calm, think and\n       picture vividly the instance of feeling calmness (as\n\n       much as possible, have the exact details).\n\n\n\n\n                               140"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:25:10 UTC +00:00]]

You may need a more dramatic or unique anchor.\n        Many people unconsciously anchor feelings of\n\n        relaxation to taking a deep breath. But perhaps that\n        is not enough to get you relaxed when life turns up\n\n        the heat. Remember that uniqueness of the anchor\n        is of key importance to successfully link the anchor\n\n        to the emotional states. You should not be confused\n        when firing an anchor with another anchor, if the\n        case may be. That is the reason why having a unique\n\n        anchor is of vital need.\n\n    3. Make sure that you use the exact same Anchor every\n        time. If you say a particular word, make sure to use the\n\n        same volume, speed, tone and pitch each time you “set”\n        the anchor. We use word anchor as our example.\n\n\n               Repeat the word ‘relax’ to yourself every\n               time that you breathe out. And, every\n\n               time you breathe out, allow yourself to\n               relax even more. If you don’t like the\n               word ‘relax’ try a different word or sound.\n\n               Notice how the word or sound goes along\n               with feelings of relaxation for you (Using\n               Anchors, n.d.).\n\n\n\n        Anchors do not have to be words; they can be a wide\nrange of things (Eason, n.d.). This wide range of things\n\ninclude small gestures of twisting a finger, rubbing earlobes\nor a wrist, or a deep breath. But if you have strengthened\nenough your link, you can then use your anchor whenever\n\nand wherever you need it so that you can get into a calm\nstate easily and at will (Using Anchors, n.d.).

It must not be a fleeting emotion. Why?\n       Because changing emotions may actually disorient you\n\n       of what you really want for yourself.\n    b.

That is the reason why, as we have\n       previously discussed in the other chapters, that your\n\n       anchor must be unique and must not be confused with\n       your other physical movements or the other anchors\n\n       for your other emotional states.

This is but normal and all of us, without\nexemption, have such mixture. But in order for us not to be\nbothered by some painful, traumatic and negative thoughts,\n\nhow we wish they would instantly vanish. This process is\nswitching our negative thoughts to positive ones. This may\n\ntake some time, but it’s worth the time and effort.\n\n       First, identify negative thoughts. This is what we call\nthe CUE pattern (Gannaway, n.d.). Reinik (2011) cited sports\n\npsychologist Alison Arnold, founder of Head Games Sports in\nWestford, Massachusetts, as an example. Arnold has coached\n\na host of Olympic athletes and warns that negative thoughts\ncan be sneaky.\n\n       Think of the specific time and place that you felt bad\nand uncomfortable. Remember the times that you felt out of\n\ncontrol and even powerless to overcome such feeling. What\nhappened to make you feel these negative emotions?\n\n\n       We know better than to tell ourselves we are\n\n       about to have a bad workout. We’re more likely\n       to make definitive statements like, “I always get\n       tired around this point,” or, “I never run well\n       in the morning,” Arnold says. And Greg Dale,\n\n       now a professor of Sport Psychology and Sport\n       Ethics and the director of sports psychology and\n       leadership programs for Duke University athletic\n\n       teams, says something as simple as the weather\n       can spur a chain of performance-hampering\n\n\n                               159"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:25:12 UTC +00:00]]

This is the process of creating how you want\n\nthe emotion or situation to be. As what we are saying before,\nit’s important to acknowledge negative thoughts.

A sure one step\n\nmakes a sure gradual change. One step at a time would make\na difference.\n\n        One negative thought a time. Rather than telling\n\nyourself that you feel fabulous when you’re slogging through a\nlong run, simply tell yourself you can make it to the next curve\n\nin the road (Reinik, 2011). Find out what works with you,\nthen, feed it. Once you figure out which positive thoughts fuel\n\nyour best performance, feed them with breathing, music and\ncontinued positive self-talk (Reinik, 2011).\n\n        Infuse long-term goals with passion.

When to set\nthe anchor?\n\n       According to the article, Using NLP Anchoring\nTechnique in Sales Setting (n.d.), the key to success with\n\nmost NLP anchoring techniques is to watch the customer\nas they access their memories.

The conclusion that we can derive from this is\nthis: memories is a depository of past experiences that can\n\nbe triggered and through visualization a sales representative\ncan easily persuade the buyer of his/her product provided s/\n\nhe knows that memories must be used as anchors. The article\nalso says that you have to watch their eyes and keep an eye out\n\nfor any subtle body movements.\n\n\n        If they suddenly drop their shoulders or become\n       otherwise relaxed, or in some cases become more\n       alert and excited, then this is the time to set the\n\n       anchor.

Visualization is a very powerful technique\naccording to authors. It can picture past and present\n\nmemorable experiences, both positive and negative.\nNonetheless, it can create projections of our future, vividly\n\nand with so much desire.\n\n       Visualization is a good anchoring technique. We can\nthink of the most desired positive emotional state that we\never want. All we just need is to anchor it in the right intensity\n\nand timing. The really cool thing about your brain is that\nit’s not very good at distinguishing between what is actually\n\nhappening to you and what you are imagining – that’s why\nyou can generate feelings double and then double again.\n\n\nPersonal application\n\n    1. Visualization actually helps us to see ourselves in a\n       positive emotional state. It enables us also to change\n\n       negative emotions or thoughts to positive ones. How\n       many times have you created projections of positive\n\n       thoughts when you are actually in your negative state?\n       How does it feel to have a switch from the negative\n\n       reality to a positive projection? Does it help you when\n       you always do this?\n\n    2. We all have our wishes. Sometimes, these are wishes\n       that we know will be hard if we shall pursue ourselves.\n\n       But the feeling it brings even though it is only a\n       thought is so intensely positive that you desire it the\n\n       most. For example, you have a secret love to a certain\n       showbiz personality but you know such thought would\n\n\n\n                              165"], ["updated_at", Thu, 18 Sep 2014 08:25:13 UTC +00:00]]

Bernard Jordan\n\n\n       remain a dream. But the thought of being with him or\n       holding his hands makes you so happy. Do you have\n\n       also experiences like this? How does it feel? Have you\n       anchored this to a certain physical trigger? What is\n       your physical trigger then? Is it helping you?\n\n    3. Sometimes, we have friends, neighbours, officemates\n\n       or someone else whom we would like to help in their\n       times of need – especially to uplift one’s emotional. Do\n\n       you have experiences when someone approached you\n       asking for someone to listen to him or her? When they\n       poured out their sentiments, what did you do? Did you\n\n       also use some anchoring techniques for them to create\n       positive thoughts?\n\n\nActivity\n\n       For this chapter, participants or readers are invited to\n\npractice anchoring using their eyes. One must have to remind\nhimself/herself that the eyes are doors to one’s inner self or\nsoul. So, by using the eyes, one can visualize using any object\n\nwhat one wants to see, experience or feel. Just as when you try\nto visualize how will your future look like or what will you be\n\nafter ten years.\n\n       Now, the following are the directions one has to be\nguided all throughout the activity. One must be keen about\neverything that will take place during and after the activity.\n\n       1. A participant or reader must take his/her time\n\n           discerning what anchors s/he needs to have and\n           objects or images to see.\n\n       2.
